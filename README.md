### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Excellent work here! Your purpose/audience/goal and Persona and Use Case are very clear and well thought out. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)    

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML looks very good. I probably would have just used an &lt;ol&gt; instead of the multi-level nested list in the Use Case flow... but that's just me :P

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

I had a tough time understanding all of the text and details in the desktop  wireframe because the image quality is not the best. From what I can gather, this is a one-page layout. That's a great way to go. :)

There are a few questions I have RE: the mobile layout, but from what I can see it looks like you have a clear idea in place about what you intend to create - and that's awesome. Nice job overall.

There are some issues with your directory structure I'd like to see cleaned up. See suggestions &amp; edits below. You HTML is superb.

Your content strategy and interaction flow all pass. Your Milestone passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development! Talk with me a bit more about what you envision for the mobile nav and behavior - it looks like you have something specific in mind that might involve some careful development. 

#### Suggestions &amp; Edits
- Change the name of your file to milestone-2.php, and move it and all of the images up one directory. Place the images in an /images directory inside /documentation.
```
/documentation
  milestone-1.php
  milestone-2.php
  /images
    desktopWire.jpg
    mobileWire2.jpg
