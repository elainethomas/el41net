### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Excellent work here! Your purpose/audience/goal and Persona and Use Case are very clear and well thought out. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)    

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML looks very good. I probably would have just used an &lt;ol&gt; instead of the multi-level nested list in the Use Case flow... but that's just me :P
